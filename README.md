# Vertix.io Revival

Vertix.io is a beloved multiplayer 2D shooter that captured the hearts of players with its fast-paced action, unique art style, and competitive gameplay. Initially launched as a browser-based game, Vertix.io provided an accessible and fun experience for casual and hardcore gamers alike. Unfortunately, the game was discontinued, leaving many fans eager to see its return.

## Our Goal
